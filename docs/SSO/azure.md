     * By using "add a group claim" option under attributes, Add in the group attribute and select "Groups assigned to 
     the application" and "Cloud-only Group Display names"
       * Claim Name: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups`
       * Value: user.groups [ApplicationGroup]
